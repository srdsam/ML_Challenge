# XBird_ML_Challenge

Evluation of ML Algorithm:
Used a regression line as the ML Model because although the data was very scattered there seemed to be a proportional relation. Also I didn't see any way a clustering or the other options on sklearn would work. The variance was 0.38 (a low score) because of the spread of the data, and the mean squared error also was ok but not great as few of the points were exactly on the line. The spread of the data makes it hard for any predictor to be more accurate without more X inputs.
